      <p>
        When you first unpack your Millboard decking boards, you'll notice their lightweight yet durable nature, ready for immediate use.
        <br /><br />
        Some important things to be aware of before starting your project:
        <br /><br />
        + A release agent will be present on the surface of the boards upon delivery, which may give a slightly shiny effect. This agent will naturally disperse in the weeks following installation.
        <br /><br />
        + Like wood, no two Millboard boards are identical in color, which gives them a more natural appearance.
        <br /><br />
        + The boards are moulded under high pressure, leading to some dimensional variance within permissible tolerances: Width: ±3mm, Length: ±5mm, Thickness: ±2mm.
        <br /><br />
        + As with wood, trimming the ends of the boards during installation may be necessary to achieve a flush, clean finish.

    question: 'What fixings should be used to fix Millboard decking?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        We recommend using Durafix® stainless steel screws, designed specifically for Millboard. There is no need to pre-drill or countersink, as the Lastane® material flexes back over the screw heads, leaving minimal marks. Larger marks can be filled, and our installation guide should be followed to achieve the best results.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Are Millboard decking colours consistent?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Millboard replicates the natural variances of wood, so color consistency between boards may vary. To ensure the best appearance, lay out all boards before installation. Samples are provided as representations of the product, but we encourage viewing full boards for a true impression.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my Millboard decking change colour over time?',
    answer: 'Millboard is designed to mimic natural wood, and like any outdoor product, it will weather over time. Yellowing, especially in the deeper grain, may occur, and loss of gloss is expected to enhance the natural look.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Millboard decking get hot in the sun?',
    answer: 'Millboard decking, like all composites, may become hotter than wood under direct sunlight. Darker colors will feel hotter. We recommend caution, especially when walking barefoot or around reflective surfaces.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Millboard decking expand or contract?',
    answer: 'Millboard has minimal expansion or contraction compared to wood, with movement up to 0.2%. We recommend a 4mm gap between boards for optimal performance and drainage.',
  },
  {
    question: 'My boards have just been laid and have a slight oily or shiny finish?',
    answer: 'The shiny finish is due to a release agent used during production, which will naturally wear off within 6-8 weeks. Cleaning the boards with warm soapy water can accelerate this process.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do my boards have water puddling on the surface?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Millboard's non-porous surface can cause water to puddle initially, but proper installation, including slight inclines and adequate gapping, will help with drainage. The release agent will dissipate over time, improving water flow.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is there a slight variation in board dimensions?',
    answer: 'Dimensional variances are due to the moulding process and the natural oak texture replicated in Millboard. We work to maintain consistent profiles, but variances within ±3mm width, ±5mm length, and ±2mm thickness are expected.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Millboard decking mark?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Millboard’s Lastane® finish is highly resistant to stains and scratches from everyday use, but care should be taken with sharp objects, spiked shoes, and animal claws. Stubborn stains should be removed promptly to prevent permanent marks.

    question: 'Where can I use Envello cladding?',
    answer: 'Envello cladding is extremely versatile and can be used for most low-level cladding areas (subject to building control). It can be used for cladding on low-level residential and commercial buildings, garden rooms, home offices, furniture, soffits and fascia, outdoor kitchens, and more. Envello can be used as the decorative face for most outdoor designs, as long as it is fixed to a structural element. All areas are subject to the relevant government regulations/building standards.',

    question: 'What should I expect when first unpacking my Envello?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        When you take your first look at your new Envello cladding boards, you will be amazed at the attention to detail and quality before you. You'll notice how lightweight yet durable the boards are, ready for immediate use.
        <br /><br />
        There are a few things we advise users to be aware of before diving in and building that dream project:
        <br /><br />
        + A release agent will be present on the surface of the boards when you take delivery of them, which may give a slightly shiny effect. This release agent has been applied so that the finished board can easily be removed from our moulds and will disperse in the weeks following installation.
        <br /><br />
        + Like wood, no two Envello cladding boards are the same colour, with the subtle differences giving the most natural appearance. This is to give your cladding all the good looks of wood cladding, but all the structural longevity of a composite material.
        <br /><br />
        + Our boards are moulded under extreme pressure and not extruded, so some dimensional variance is expected. The tolerances that we permit for the size of our cladding boards are limited to: Width: ±3mm, Length: ±5mm, Thickness: ±2mm.
        <br /><br />
        + As with wood, it may be necessary to trim the ends of the boards during installation to achieve a flush, clean finish.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Are Envello cladding colours consistent?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Millboard has been designed to replicate the natural variances of wood, and we do not intend for the product to have identical shades. Buying all the Envello cladding you need at the same time should help to ensure that the colour is as consistent as possible.
        <br /><br />

  },
  {
    question: 'Will my Envello change colour over time?',
    answer: 'We go to extraordinary lengths to recreate the look of natural wood. As with all products exposed to the elements, including sunlight, snow, and rain, Millboard will naturally weather and tone down over time. Slight yellowing, especially in the deeper grain of our cladding boards, will be visible, and loss of gloss is expected and intentional. This is in order to replicate the natural piece of wood it has been moulded against, along with our unique hand-coloured process.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are the Envello cladding boards fire rated?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Our Shadow Line+ and Board & Batten+ cladding boards have been tested to BS EN 13501-1 and have a classification of D-s3, d0.
        <br /><br />
        The responsibility for the cladding’s suitability in the required location is to be determined by a certified building professional (building control, building insurance, fire officer, etc). Millboard will not be held responsible for incorrect specification, application, or product installation in areas not in accordance with government guidance, in the UK or abroad. Current guidance should be gained from the government website relating to the geographical project location.
      </p>

  {
    question: 'Does Envello cladding expand or contract?',
    answer: 'As Millboard is made from a resin mineral composition, it is stable compared to wood or composites based on wood, with an acceptable movement of up to 0.2%.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is there a slight variation in board dimensions?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        There will always be a slight variance in the board’s dimensions due to the fact that we mould from natural oak and due to the pressure of the moulding process. Despite this, we calibrate the boards to maintain as consistent a profile as possible. The manufacturing tolerances are: Width: ±3mm, Length: ±5mm, Thickness: ±2mm.
        <br /><br />
        When working with the boards, a level may be required to help keep the boards running upright or level. To achieve straight and consistent 5-6mm gapping between the Shadow Line+ boards, it may be necessary to use our Millboard Multi-Spacers during the installation process.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Envello Cladding mark?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        The elastomeric finish is highly resistant to scratches and everyday wear and tear. Take care to keep sharp objects away from the boards, as they can leave marks if moved against the surface. The risk of marking from strong dyes and stains will be reduced if removed as soon as possible. This also applies to cooking oils or fats that come into contact with the boards' surface.
        <br /><br />
        Please cover and protect the boards from surrounding building or landscaping works, painting, rendering, or cementitious dust that could contaminate or mark the surface, especially if the boards have been recently installed. Millboard will not be held responsible for issues arising from the boards being affected by foreign substances, as this does not represent a fault with the product. We can recommend cleaning solutions to address contamination concerns or in situations where our guidance has not been followed.

  },
  {
    question: 'How do I clean my Envello Cladding?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        If the board surface becomes dirty during installation, it should be cleaned as soon as possible using warm soapy water (dishwashing liquid) and a brush. Clean your cladding when required to remove general dirt particles. Start cleaning at the top of the cladding and work downwards along the grain. It is best to use a brush with an extendable handle to clean the boards.
        <br /><br />
        Cover the boards from any surrounding building works or painting that could mark the surface of the boards. Stubborn marks may be removed with a range of different cleaners, depending on the mark. Please contact us for more information at technical@millboard.co.uk.

      <p>
        Pressure washers can be used carefully on Envello cladding for cleaning and rinsing.
        <br /><br />
        We recommend the following guidelines:
        <br />
        • A PSI no greater than 2,000 should be used, with a 40 to 60-degree spread fan tip.
        <br />
        • The head should always be kept around 300mm away from the surface.
        <br />
        • Direct, prolonged, and intense contact could damage the surface of the boards.

  {
    question: "What is the difference between wood joists and DuoSpan or Plas-Pro joists?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Wood is the most commonly used subframe material. However, wood only performs well under ideal circumstances and if the cut elements are regularly retreated. In applications where the wood is in contact with the ground or has limited airflow, the intended lifespan of the frame can be impeded significantly.
        <br /><br />
        Our recommendation is to use our innovative DuoSpan framework or Plas-Pro to achieve a non-rot solution.
        <br /><br />
        When using Plas-Pro as an alternative to wood, please bear in mind that the structural spans are not equivalent. Please refer to the Plas-Pro brochures and installation guides for further details.
